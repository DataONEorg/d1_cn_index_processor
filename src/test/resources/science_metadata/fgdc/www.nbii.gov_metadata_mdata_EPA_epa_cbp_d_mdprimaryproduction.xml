<abstract>
The overall phytoplankton monitoring program is
designed to detect and monitor changes in plankton
production in relation to changing water quality
conditions in Chesapeake Bay. Phytoplankton are
the dominant producers in the Chesapeake Bay and
are the base of the food chain for many higher
tropic levels.  Excessive blooms  of plankton
species are considered evidence of eutrophication
in the bay and are known to degrade water quality
and block light from submerged aquatic vegetation.
Sampling is performed in conjunction with  the
Maryland phytoplankton, fluorometry,
mesozooplankton, microzooplankton, jellyfish and
water quality monitoring programs.    Carbon
fixation rates (C-14) were obtained from replicate
surface layer composite samples at 16 stations in
the Maryland portion of the Chesapeake Bay and its
tributaries. Samples were collected 18 times over
the year, with monthly samples in October through
March, and biweekly samples in April through
September.

Primary production samples are collected by a
member of the Benedict Estuarine Research
Laboratory plankton section.  At the end of the
sampling cruise, the samples are transferred to
the C14 laboratory staff.  Production and
alkalinity measurements are made within
twenty-four hours of  sample collection.
Chlorophyll a measurements are immediately frozen
until analysis is performed.  All Chlorophyll
samples are processed within 2 months of sample
collection.

Samples were collected 18 times over the year,
with monthly samples in October through March, and
biweekly samples in April through September. In
January and February, the stations in the Choptank
River and Baltimore Harbor are not sampled. After
June, 1986 stations ET4.2 and EE3.1 were no longer
sampled. Beginning in January 1996, there was no
sampling done in February  and November. Sampling
was reduced to once a month in June and September.
Sampling at Station CB1.1 was discontinued
entirely.

At the end of a sampling day, four 100 milliliters
subsamples per station are decanted from the two
surface-layer composite samples into sample-rinsed
Pyrex milk dilution bottles (or polycarbonate
bottles after July, 1989), one for time-zero C-14
blank (t0), one for alkalinity determination, and
one from each composite for C-14 incubation.  The
two incubation samples per station are placed in a
constant light incubator (&gt;250 uE per sq m per
sec) receiving running water from the study area
for temperature control for an acclimation period &gt;0.5 h.  Then 1-2 uCi labeled NaHCO3 is added and
samples are returned to the incubator for &gt;1 h.  After incubation, 15 ml is filtered through a 0.45
um membrane filter, rinsed with filtered sample
water and fumed over concentrated HCl.  Fifteen ml
of t0 sample is similarly filtered and fumed.  The
filters are placed in scintillation vials and
stored in a freezer.
