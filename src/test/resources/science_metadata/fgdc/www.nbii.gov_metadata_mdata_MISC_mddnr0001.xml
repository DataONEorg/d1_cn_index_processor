<abstract>
Dataset containing information taken from field sheets
completed during CBRM's (stands for) Modified Fall Survey pertaining to spat
counts, spat size distribution, seed and shell information on each bar, and
fouling information for each bar.
Dataset contains information designed to characterize and assess the
condition and trends of Maryland oyster populations.  The program to collect
the data was developed as a modification to the Department of Natural
Resources, Division of Fisheries, existing Fall Oyster Survey.  The purpose of
the modifications was to develop a valid long-term oyster monitoring program
from an existing survey which was geared to providing qualitative information
on a site specific basis, primarily for specific fishery management needs.
</abstract>
<purpose>
Long term oyster monitoring program designed to characterize and assess the
conditions and trends of Maryland's oyster populations.
The design of the modified survey is intended to provide annual estimates of
Baywide and regional oyster spatfall intensity, mortality, disease, and
population size structure.  Statistical validity and consistency of data were
paramount considerations in the modified oyster design.  The aim was to assist
oyster management with a reliable and useful representation of the resource,
based upon a feasible and cost-effective monitoring program consistent with
historical observations.

Important deviations from sampling
Inconsistencies shown in 2.3 had little or no impact on the results
reported in the report.  The majority of comparisons between years are
represented as averages. where summations were used in analysis,
aggregate differences between years greatly outweighed any variation
due to single sites.
</attraccr>
</attracc>
<logic>not applicable</logic>
<complete>
Small inconsistencies between 1990 and 1991 sampling occurred due to
oversights in coordination.  In 1990, Manokin River-Drum Point was
omitted from the 64 monitoring sites Oyster bars selected for the
disease subsample also varied from the 42 initially chosen.  In 1991,
one other oyster bar CRRO was analyzed for disease.  This additional
site is now considered as part of the disease monitoring subset.
These inconsistencies had little or no impact on the results reported.

<methtype>Sampling</methtype>
<methdesc>
The choice of fall for sampling is a compromise among three factors:
1) the spring-summer spat set must grow to a size to be visually
identified: 2/ P. marinus and H. Nelsoni generally have exerted their
effects on the population (mortality) during the preceding summer; 3)
although the oyster harvest season begins before the time of sampling,
early fall sampling minimizes the effects of harvest, given the other
constraints on the survey
</methdesc>
</method>
<method>
<methtype>Dredge Sampling Methodology</methtype>
<methdesc>
Oyster dredges had a 3 foot (91.4 cm.) wide opening with 12 teeth on
the bottom trawl bar.  Tooth length varied between 2.5 - 3.25 in (6.3
- 8.3 cm.)  A chain bag constructed of 2 inch (5.1 cm) diameter steel
rings extended back 20 inches (50.8 cm.) along the bottom of the
trawls.  the remainder of the trawl bags were constructed of 1.5 inch
(3.8 cm.) square nylon mesh.  A completely filled dredge holds
approximately 2.0 bushels of material.
Five independent dredge tows were taken from each of the 64 sites.
Tow distance was based on filling the dredge bag with sufficient
material to provide a complete sample.  From each of these five tows,
0.2 bushels of material was extracted at random.  Variables 1-3 below
were recorded separately from each of the five samples.  Variables 4-6
were recorded from the pooled full sample.
1. Total spat count
2. Measurement of each live oyster to 5 mm size classes
3.  Measurement of oyster boxes (dead oysters with two shell halves
still attached)
4.  Fouling of the sample was determined by category (mussels, Molgula
manhattensis, other) If there was sufficient fouling to affect sample
volume significantly, fouling organisms were removed before taking 0.2
bushel subsamples.
5.  A history of seed and shell placement on the sampled portion of
the oyster bar was recorded by year of activity.
6.  Site identifications, salinity, temperature, and bottom depth.
7.  At sites designated for disease samples, 30 or more oysters
greater than 50 mm in length were selected at random and returned to
the Cooperative Oxford Laboratory for disease analysis.  The minimum
size restriction was due to laboratory processing limitations.

<methtype>Laboratory Disease Analysis</methtype>
<methdesc>
Diagnosis for P. marinus and H. nelsoni was conducted at the
Cooperative Oxford Laboratory.  The standard technique employed for
P. marinus analysis was rectal thioglycollate culture (Ray 1952).
Blood thioglycollate culture was also employed for most sites in 1990
and a small number of sites in 1991.
Analysis for H. nelsoni was conducted for selected sites in both 1990
and 1991.  Site selection was based on presence of high salinity in
areas where resurgence of the disease was expected first to occur.
Both blood histocytology and tissue histocytology methods were
employed for diagnosis, depending upon site and year.
Laboratory analysis determined individual levels of infection for both
P. marinus and H. nelsoni for 30 oysters from a given oyster bar.
Stages ranged from 0 (no infection detected), to 7 (highest infection
detectable).  Three representative indices were calculated for each
oyster bar.

where Di = number of oysters at a given stage (i = 1-7) infected in
the sample; I = number of oysters in the sample having infection
(stage 1-7); N = total number of oysters in the sample (30)
Data were entered into the computer directly from field sheets (Figure
3).  Interactive entry programs prompt the user for study specific
data. Data storage, entry, and analysis were primarily in dBase III +
format.  All field data sheet information was entered and used in
analysis.
Present use of the data entry and analysis system has been for MFS data
only.  However, the computer sorting and filtering routines allow for
entry and analysis of any oyster field data that follow the format of
the MFS field sheet.  Examples of such supplementary oyster data which
could be analyzed are seasonal surveys, response surveys for critical
needs, and seed and shell planting analyses.  Files and program
routines are on hand to identify known oyster bars and seed and shell
plantings with correct geographical designations.
Appendix A details data storage file field descriptions and statistical
calculations used to generate the summary statistics file.
