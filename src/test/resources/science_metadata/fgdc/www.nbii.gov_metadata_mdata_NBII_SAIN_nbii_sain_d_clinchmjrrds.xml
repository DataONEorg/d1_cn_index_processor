<abstract>Major roads within Clinch watershed. Includes name, locations, FIPS code of state, length, and FCC of interstates, highways, and other major thoroughfares.</abstract>

<purpose>

Provides road locations to aid the visualization of water chemistry sample site locations within the Clinch River watershed project area. Originally produced for the Southern Appalachian Man and the Biosphere (SAMAB) 2002 Fall Conference by the National Biological Information Infrastructure (NBII) Southern Appalachian Information Node (SAIN) for the SAMAB Southern Appalachian Volunteer Environmental Monitoring

(SAVEM) program.

</purpose>

<supplinf>Largest scale when displaying the data: 1:50,000.  (previous geoform was 'vector digital data'). PJ Nabors, Biogeographer, was the original access point of contact and metadata author.</supplinf>

<logic>No duplicate features are present.  The shapefile is exported using Avenue request ExportClean.  This request verifies and enforces the correctness of shapes.</logic>

<horizpar>

The geospatial part of this data set was extracted from the 1990 Census Version TIGER/Line&amp;#194;&amp;#174; files (CD&amp;#226;&amp;#128;&amp;#147;ROM edition). To improve the accuracy, GDT ran a process against the entire nationwide database. The positional accuracy of this data set exceeds the positional accuracy of the TIGER/Line coordinates.

The positional accuracy of the TIGER/Line coordinates varies with the source materials used but at best meets the established National Map Accuracy standards (+/- 167 feet approximately) where 1:100,000-scale maps from the USGS are the source. The Census Bureau cannot specify the accuracy of feature updates added by its field staff or of features derived from the GBF/DIME-Files or other map sources. Thus, the level of positional accuracy in the TIGER/Line files is not suitable for high-precision measurement applications such as engineering problems, property transfers, or other uses that might require highly accurate measurements of the earth&amp;#226;&amp;#128;&amp;#153;&amp;#226;&amp;#132;&amp;#162;s surface.
