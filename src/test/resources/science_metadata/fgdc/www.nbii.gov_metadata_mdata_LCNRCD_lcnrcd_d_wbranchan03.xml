<abstract>

Because of the well known problems of the river, the West Branch was identified as a restoration implementation site to be funded as part of the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) Project Impact Initiative.  The Lamoille County Planning Commission (LCPC) coordinated the project development and construction of the river restoration project on the West Branch in Stowe, Vermont between 2000 and 2001.  This is Phase I of the project.  There is significant amount of work planned for both the West Branch and the main stem of the Little River.

The West Branch is a classic example of degraded river system due to multiple human disturbances.  Occurring excessively in the 1980's, gravel mining was just one of these disturbances. This reduction of sediment over-widened the stream channel, disallowing sufficient sediment transport.  As of 2003, the West Branch (5.8 miles) is listed on the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) 303(d) impaired waters list for the pollution listing of physical habitat changes.

There are several causes of instability on the West Branch, including excessive gravel mining, urban runoff, and floodplain encroachments.  All of these have led to the West Branch's active stream channel losing connection to its floodplain in many locations. The stream has responded to these human induced disturbances by trying to reestablish a new floodplain at a lower elevation and degrading its bed. The bed degradation has migrated upstream (head cut) and created additional instability. The head cut has also caused the adjoining tributaries to become unstable, further contributing to the excess sedimentation of the West Branch. During this valley forming process, additional stream energy has remained in the channel causing streambanks to oversteepen and the additional bank erosion has lead to a channel bed build up of sediment (aggradation). This sedimentation process has many adverse impacts on fisheries habitat and water quality. Deep pool areas have filled in with sediment and fish spawning habitat has become smothered with fine sediment.

Creating quality trout habitat in the West Branch was one of the restoration goals of the project.  By re-establishing a stable reach of the river and providing habitat for all life stages of trout, the project partners hoped to achieve increases of instream cover and greater depth in pools.

In order to assess changes to the project area over a period of time, permanent photographic stations were established along the river.  These photo stations are documented by Michael S. Adams of the Army Corps of Engineers on the site plans.  Pre-restoration photos were taken by Mr. Adams prior to construction in 2001.  These photos, titled 'Army Corps of Engineers Pre-Restoration Photo Inventory (2001) of the West Branch in Stowe, VT' can be found zipped with this dataset. The first year of photos were taken on September 27, 2002 and the second year photos were taken on September 8, 2003. These restoration photos </abstract>

<purpose>The purpose of the project was to implement streambank and fisheries habitat restoration by stabilizing eroding riverbanks, restoring floodplain access, and creating a geomorphologically stable channel, which may in turn have a positive effect on the sedimentation problems farther downstream, including the Waterbury Reservoir. This metadata documents aspects of the project implementation in 2001 and first year post-monitoring of this project in 2002. By conducting the post-construction monitoring (2002, 2003, and 2004), we will document the changes occurring in the stream and determine the success of Phase I of this project in order to assess the success of the fairly new bioengineering techniques used in this project.  The Army Corps of Engineers has designated the West Branch under their Section 206 Habitat Restoration Projects.</purpose>

<attraccr>Data meets current VGIS Surface Water Data Standards in its partial implementation.  Attribute information for each restoration site was acquired by GPS data collection.  Attributes have been quality checked by the person responsible for the data collection-and found to accurately represent the features on the ground.</attraccr>

</attracc>

<logic>Points, nodes, lines, and areas conform to topological rules. Lines intersect only at nodes, and all nodes anchor the ends of lines. Lines do not overshoot or undershoot other lines where they are supposed to meet. There are no duplicate lines. Lines bound areas and lines identify the areas to the left and right of the lines. Gaps and overlaps among areas do not exist. All areas close. Network lines exist within all two dimensional "2d" features to ensure "hydrologic connectivity"  from headwater reaches to receiving waters through the network of single line "1d", and "2d" rivers and lakes. "Dummy" lines separate polygonal rivers from lakes and exist nowhere else.</logic>

This data layer is based on the best available surface water data across the state and has been enhanced via on-screen digitizing with the aid of photo-interpreting RF 5,000 scale orthophotos, derived contours and multi-spectral aerial photographs. It has not been subject to field checking. River and lakeshore features are seasonal and have been interpreted at the feature's position as of the date of the source photos. The best available surface water data sources include layers from VCGI, Regional Planning Commissions, Town GIS offices, USGS DLG, Regional projects (i.e., NFLRI, VBP etc.) and more. Standardized delineation methodologies were followed throughout the compilation of this data providing a high degree of consistency.  All sections were taken as sections of lines, or the right or left banks of two arcs.

"CERTIFIED"  NHD DATA: Transport reaches are defined on nearly all features of type: stream/river, canal/ditch, artificial path, pipeline, and connector. Water body reaches are defined on the subset of lake/pond features identified as water bodies. Geographic names, where present, were carried over from both 1:24k DLG hydrography data and from the best available source data. Near the international boundaries with Canada, only the parts of features within the United States are delineated. Detailed capture conditions are provided for every feature type in the Standards for NHD (USGS, 1999), available online through &lt;http://mapping.usgs.gov/standards/.&gt;

This dataset does not claim to include all potential or conducted river restoration sites in Lamoille County, VT.

Compiled to meet 4.92 meters horizontal accuracy at 95% confidence level. Tested (value varies by sub basin-see below) meters horizontal accuracy at 95% confidence level.  These values do not account for the error of the source digital orthophotos (approx. +/- 6 meters) on which the data is based. Horizontal accuracy was assessed by comparing 20 well defined "check" points of the source RF 5,000 scale digital orthophotos against derived surface water data. This approach is detailed in the FGDC Geospatial Positioning Accuracy Standards (&lt;http://www.fgdc.gov/standards/status/sub1_3.html&gt;). Digitized data was overlaid upon the RF 5k scale digital orthophotos. Check points were assessed on-screen to determine the spatial difference between the delineated vector data features and the location of the features on the orthophotos. Check points are any combination of the following features: 1) Confluences of one dimensional streams ("1d" or single line streams); 2) Confluences of two dimensional streams ("2d" or double line streams represented as polygons); 3) Polygonal lake and pond features; and 4) Distinct island features. Personnel other than the originator conducted accuracy analysis. Data is believed to be of uniform positional accuracy. Potential errors were deemed to be random, thus check points were dispersed across the extent of the data.

Additional enhancement to data accuracy involved the use of RF 40,000 scale 1992-93 NAPP color infrared aerial photos (Lamoille and White River Sub basins only). The RF 5,000 scale surface water data was plotted at RF 20,000 scale and overlaid onto enlargements (RF 20,000 scale) of the photos to determine errors of omission of water polygons. Errors noted on Mylar were digitized on-screen using digital orthophotos.

River restoration sites were GPS'd using Trimble Pathfinder Basic Plus.  Points were verified using benchmarks and found to be within 2 meters of accuracy.

Assessment of horizontal accuracy was conducted by following guidelines outlined in "FGDC Geospatial Positioning Accuracy Standards Part 3: National Standards for Spatial Data Accuracy", section 3.2.2 Accuracy Test Guidelines (&lt;http://www.fgdc.gov/standards/status/sub1_3.html&gt;).  Accuracy checking is ideally conducted by a third party using an independent data source of higher accuracy than that used to create the data being tested.

The accuracies reported were generated under the following conditions:

1)  Personnel other than the original editor conducted accuracy analysis,

2) The best "independent source of higher accuracy" available is the RF 5000 scale Vermont Mapping Program digital orthophotos on which the original editing is based, and

3) Potential errors were deemed to be random, thus test points were dispersed across the entire extent of the data.

OVERVIEW - Twenty random "check" points were generated along the finalized surface water drainage network and compared against their actual "test" points on the ground that were visible using the RF 5,000 scale digital orthophotos.

Horizontal accuracy was assessed by conducting the following steps in ArcView&amp;#194;&amp;#174; for each sub basin:

1) The finalized surface water data was assessed to ensure that a single route represented the entire 8 digit cataloging unit (sub basin). If one didn't exist then it was created.

2) Using the ArcView&amp;#194;&amp;#174; extension "randpts.avx", a user extension created by Jeff Jenness, a Wildlife Biologist and GIS Analyst with the US Forest Service at the Rocky Mountain Research Station in Flagstaff, AZ, 20 random points were generated as "check" points. This extension is available from the ESRI Arc Scripts website.

3) The "check" points and surface water data were overlaid upon the RF 5000 scale digital orthophotos to assess "check points with their true locations, i.e., "test" points. Test point locations were stored in a separate point theme. A "key" field was maintained between these data sets. In some locations it was not possible to determine a "test" point with a high level of confidence so the "check" point was moved to the closest location along the same linear feature where a  "test" location could be adequately determined on the orthophoto. Check points included any combination of the following features: A) Confluences of one dimensional streams "1d" or single line streams); B) Confluences of two dimensional streams ("2d" or double line streams represented as polygons); C) Polygonal lake and pond features; and D) Distinct island features.

4) Using the ArcView&amp;#194;&amp;#174; sample script "addxycoo.ave", X,Y coordinates were added to the features tables of both the "check and "test" point attribute tables. These were then exported to comma delimited text files.

5) Using an Excel spreadsheet, created by the Minnesota Planning Land Management Information Center in a publication titled the "Positional Accuracy Handbook: Using the National Standard for Spatial Data Accuracy to measure and report geographic data quality " (http://www.mnplan.state.mn.us/press/accurate.html), the delimited files were imported. This spreadsheet contains all formulas necessary to generate the NSSDA statistic representing average horizontal positional accuracy.

Source data for each sub basin is a composite of surface water data from different sources created using varying methodologies by numerous entities. Therefore, reported accuracy values are reported for this composite data. Features in this data are believed to be of uniform positional accuracy. Accuracy value does not take into account the horizontal positional accuracy of the source digital orthophotos, on which the data is based.

STRUCTURAL COMPONENTS &amp; ASSESSMENT:

An assessment of the condition and performance of the structures occurred during the monitoring year.  Below is a list of installed practices that occurred in 2001 and the performance evaluation.  Note that stations are measured on the ground in feet from the beginning of the restoration section upstream to the end of the restoration section.  For example, station 24+00 equates to 2400 feet from the beginning of the section.  Station 28+50 equates to 2850 feet from the beginning of the restoration section.  NOTE, however, that the measurement units are in meters for the spatial dataset.  Photographs were taken of the eight stations and can be found zipped with the spatial dataset located at the spatial download site (see Metadata Section 6 - Distribution).

a. A grade control structure was installed at Station 7+00, consisting of a rock vane with two root wads.  Purpose: to prohibit downstream headcut migration.  A secondary function of the grade control structure was to improve fisheries habitat.

STATUS  This structure is appropriately prohibiting upstream headcutting and a pocket is beginning to scour out creating a pool for fish habitat.

b. Double tree revetments were installed from Station 12+96 - 17+00.

Amendment: Tree revetments were not installed from 11+50 - 12+96 because the &amp;#226;&amp;#128;&amp;#156;J vane was not installed.  This section from 11+50 - 12+96 was riprapped.  Purpose: to protect bank from erosion and stabilize banks until vegetation can take hold.

STATUS  The tree revetments above the first rock vane are performing well and protecting the bank from further erosion.  The section of revetments below the first vane was blown out in the summer of 2002.  This section was repaired in the fall of 2002 with a toe rock revetment and the bank was sloped. The bank was planted with three rows of willows in the spring of 2003, which are establishing themselves well.

c. Two rock vanes were installed at Stations 13+00 and 13+70.

Amendment: The third &amp;#226;&amp;#128;&amp;#156;J vane was not installed, but instead the bank was riprapped. The vane was not installed because the blue-silt was not an adequate foundation for the vane. Purpose: vanes were designed to slow velocities along the bank by directing flows to the center of the waterway.  This will allow sediments to collect along the bank, narrowing the channel.  STATUS: The first vane initially served this purpose until the structure partially breached following the first storm event in 2002, which in turn blew out the tree revetments below it.  This breach in the first vane allows water to move through the vane.  This makes the vane shorter in length, but water velocity is still slowing along the bank, allowing sediment to slowly collect.  A deep pool has also formed on the backside of the vane.  When constructed, the second (downstream) vane did not encroach as far into the channel as the upstream vane and presently is not completely intact.  This breach in the first vane will be closely monitored to see if it is not performing its purpose and if corrective repair would need to take place.

d. The two rock weirs at Stations 21+75 and 23+50 were not installed because the blue-silt sediments did not provide an adequate foundation.

Amendment: Because the bearing capacity of the substrate below the armor layer endangered the equipment, operation was not possible.  Rock had already been dumped over the bank with no way of retrieval.  In order to provide the level of grade control that a riffle line would, the rock was randomly placed on the bed and pushed down so it was flush with the bed.  Essentially the two weirs were converted to riffles. Purpose: Create a grade control in the incised section of river to reduce erosion on the banks and streambed.

STATUS  The constructed riffles are somewhat intact.  A few of the boulders have moved, but the riffles still exist.  No erosion of the banks or streambed is occurring.

e. A riffle-pool sequence from Stations 20+26 - 30+50 was established by raising the channel bed elevation by 1&amp;#226;&amp;#128;&amp;#153;-2&amp;#226;&amp;#128;&amp;#153;.  A plan for relocation, creation of floodplain access and the placement of riprap along 500 linear feet of the right bank from Stations 24+00-29+00 was also established.  A point bar was constructed on the left bank extending a maximum of 25&amp;#226;&amp;#128;&amp;#153; beyond the existing OHW. Purpose: create a geomorphologically stable channel with floodplain access and provide energy dissipation at bankfull discharges.

STATUS  The new channel is intact, maintaining its dimension, pattern and profile.

VEGETATION:

The creation of a woody riparian buffer is essential to a successful project. In order to officially establish these buffers, adjacent landowners entered into US Fish and Wildlife Service Partners for Fish and Wildlife agreements. These agreements stated that the landowner would keep a 25 foot riparian buffer for 20 years. The LCNRCD was responsible for coordinating the ordering of the vegetative plantings and was responsible for the completion of the spring plantings.  The majority of the vegetation was installed in the spring of 2002, with few exceptions as mentioned below.

River Bank Bioengineering

The bank section below the first rock vane, which was repaired in the fall of 2002, was planted with three rows of willow wattles in the spring of 2003, in order to stabilize the highly erodible bank above the stone toe rock revetment. The willows have established well and are healthy.

Riparian Buffer

The majority of the vegetated buffer was planted in the spring of 2002.  Because a repair job was done on the river in November 2002, the section of buffer on the downstream portion of Percy&amp;#226;&amp;#128;&amp;#153;s land was replanted in the spring 2003.   In the spring of 2002, plantings were only placed in the 10-15&amp;#226;&amp;#128;&amp;#153; section of buffer that had been fenced off.  After working with the landowner to fence off the proper footage, the final fenced off riparian area of 25&amp;#226;&amp;#128;&amp;#153; was then fully planted. This completed the plantings within the whole riparian buffer.

The buffer was planted with balled and burlaped trees supplied by Gary Drinkwater Nursery of Hardwick, Vermont. The large trees were supplied by the Gary Drinkwater Nursery in Hardwick, Vermont.  He supplied us with trees ranging from 11-15&amp;#226;&amp;#128;&amp;#153; in height and 1-2 caliper.  Each tree and shrub had a burlap brush blanket in order to keep weed growth down around the base of the plantings.  The trees also had a plastic tree guard surrounding their trunk in order to discourage girdling by rodents.  The tree species were red maple, sugar maple, white ash, gray birch and white birch.  A total of 50 large trees were planted in the spring of 2003. The riparian plantings were performed in the spring of 2003 by Jim Smith; a stream restoration contractor with significant experience in riparian plantings.

The project site was assessed on September 8, 2003, in order to assess the health and survival of the planted stock and document any suggested changes.

Upstream section, Stations 24+00 to 28+50:

There was 100% survival of the large trees and approximately 70% survival of the small trees and shrubs.  The trees and shrubs were free of any disease or insect infestation.  There was also no evidence of wildlife or rodent damage to the plantings.  The plantings appeared to be stable and hardy.  The newly formed floodplain had been planted with a mixture of willows and live stakes.  The row of willows closest to the river had excellent survival.  The middle section (3rd, 4th, 5th rows) or willows had approximately 50-60% survival.  There were a few large patches were the willows did not take root. It appears that high waters had washed away some of the sediment covering the willows.  The willows planted on the upper section (closest to the recreation path) had approximately 75-80% survival.  The willows were in excellent health.

Downstream section, Stations 12+00 to 17+00:

There is 90% survival of the large trees and approximately 70% survival of the small trees and shrubs.  The large trees exhibited some sort of insect damage to the leaves.  This will be monitored during the next year to see if any action needs to occur.  There was also no evidence of wildlife damage to the plantings.  The plantings appeared to be stable and hardy.  The willows planted in the spring of 2002 were in excellent health.  Three rows of willows had been planted in the spring of 2003 and with the exception of a few patches were also exhibiting strong growth.

REPAIR/MAINTENANCE:

No repair or maintenance was performed at the project site during monitoring year 2003.  The section of bank that was blown out in spring/summer of 2002 and fixed in November 2002 is performing well and no further erosion is occurring.

FISHERIES:

Creating quality trout habitat in the West Branch was one of the restoration goals of the project.  By re-establishing a stable reach of the river and providing habitat for all life stages of trout, the project partners hoped to achieve increases of instream cover and greater depth in pools.  The most upstream section of the project site consists dominantly of riffle habitat.  This riffle habitat will be a food source and a place where oxygenated water flows freely.  The constructed riffles will allow trout to feed from biological drift.  The right bank is riprapped with smaller rock, which currently does not provide much cover.  The willows on the lower terrace will eventually shade the river and provide stability.  The trees and shrubs on the upper terrace will provide shade, stability and become a beneficial food source for fish.  On the backside (downstream end) of the first vane, a pool has formed providing some nice fish habitat.  This provides a deeper, slower area directly adjacent to the riffle created by the vane which is a beneficial area for fish to rest without expending energy. As the vegetation grows in this section, it will provide the river with shade, a decrease in sediment loads and a good source of food matter.  The revetments are also providing good cover.  The grade control structure consisting of a rock vane with two root wads has created a pool which establishes a beneficial area of deep water.  Overall the project reach is slowly establishing a prime mix of habitat features for trout and other aquatic species.

RECOMMENDATIONS:

As of the writing of this report, there has been no determination of a need for repair or changes at this restoration site.  The project team will continue to discuss positives and negatives of the project process and outcome.  Discussion regarding the structural integrity and complexities of the site will also continue.  The LCNRCD will continue to monitor the project area in the upcoming year.

The engineering firm Dubois and King performed a hydraulic analysis on the West Branch using the 2000 version of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers HEC-RAS hydraulic model. They utilized the most appropriate existing hydrology (peak rates of discharge) developed by others (Flood Insurance Studies, previous engineering reports, etc.).  Flood discharges for the bank full event (Q1.5), 5 year, 10 year, 25 year, 50 year, and 100 year events were obtained and utilized.

Cross sections were developed from the 3-dimensional ground survey and were linked to the river stationing indicated on the base map.  The cross sections along with other appropriate data (roughness coefficients, expansion and contraction losses, etc) were coded into the HEC-RAS and an existing condition hydraulic model was developed.  The model computes appropriate hydraulic information such as water surface profiles, channel velocities, shear values along the edge of a bank, critical depth locations, hydraulic jumps, and other appropriate information necessary for the use in design of the river stabilization improvements.

The hydraulic engineer observed and documented the sediment transport capacity of the channel.  Using the average channel velocities, the critical velocity to induce bed material transport and the fall velocity of the average pebble size in the channel, Dubois and King made an assessment of the sediment transport capacity of the channel.

Following the approval of improvements, Dubois and King prepared the engineering plans (site plans and site details) for the restoration construction in August of 2000. Modifications were submitted and approved by the Army Corps of Engineers in October, 2002.  The As-Built and As-Planted engineering plans were prepared by the U.S. Department of Agriculture, Natural Resources Conservation Service.  Some of these plans have been zipped with and served with this dataset.  For additional information about the engineering plans, contact the Lamoille County Natural Resources Conservation District.

"CERTIFIED" NHD DATA: The VHD, as part of the NHD is a "core framework" dataset, is a comprehensive set of digital spatial data that encodes information about naturally occurring and constructed bodies of water, paths through which water flows, and related entities. The information encoded about features includes classification by type, other characteristics, a unique common identifier, the feature length or area, and (rarely) the elevation of the surface of water pools and a description of the stage of the elevation. For reaches, encoded information includes a reach code, the date the reach code was assigned, a unique common identifier, the reach length or area, and, for transport reaches, the stream level. Geographic names, and their identifiers in the Geographic Names Information System, are assigned to reaches or, if no reach is available, to features. The data also contain relations among reaches that encode the direction of water flow, metadata, and information that supports the exchange of future updates and improvements to the data.

Attributes are present that were not developed as part of the NHD dataset and standard, and that are not part of any standards.  Note the Attribute Definition Source to identify source agencies.

"CERTIFIED" NHD DATA: Ultimately, the VHD will only contain NHD compliant attributes.  For an overview on the VHD  feature types, characteristics, and values, review the latest U.S. Geological Survey, "Standards for National Hydrography Dataset - High Resolution": Reston, Virginia, U.S. Geological Survey. The document is available online through &lt;http://mapping.usgs.gov/standards/&gt;. Information about tables and fields in the data are available from the "Concepts and Contents" document at the NHD Technical Reference homepage (http://NHD.usgs.gov/techref.html).

Attributes are present that were not developed as part of the NHD dataset and standard, and that are not part of any standards.  Note the Attribute Definition Source to identify source agencies.
