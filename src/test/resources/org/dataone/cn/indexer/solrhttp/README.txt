Files in this directory represent a typical data package consisting of:

1 DATA object
1 METADATA object
1 RESOURCE_MAP object

Multiple copies of the system metadata are provided reflecting different
states after replication occurs.

Note that only the serialVersion is incremented when replicas are added.
