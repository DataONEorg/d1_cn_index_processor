DataONE CN Index Task Processor
------------------------

This component provides index task processing of index tasks created by the index task generator component.
The processor converts an index task item into a solr index update request.

This project is a consummer of the IndexTask repository provided by cn_index_common component.  
The generator's spring configuration (application-Context.xml) imports the task-index-context.xml to
provide repository access.

The production configuration context file (processor-daemon-context.xml) adds production references to
external configuration including the jdbc.properties and solr.properties.

See the test classes under src/test for example usage and test-context.xml for test runtime configuration.
The integration test - IndexTaskProcessingIntegrationTest makes use of the generator daemon and the processor
daemon classes.  Since these classes load configuration from a production environment, configuration should
be present in /etc/dataone/indexing.  This includes jdbc.properties, hazelcast.xml, solr.properties.
