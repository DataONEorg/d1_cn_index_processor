DataONE CN Index Task Processor
------------------------

This component provides index task processing of index tasks created by the index task generator component.
The processor converts an index task item into a solr index update request.

This project is a consummer of the IndexTask repository provided by cn_index_common component.  
The generator's spring configuration (application-Context.xml) imports the task-index-context.xml to
provide repository access.

The production configuration context file (processor-daemon-context.xml) adds production references to
external configuration including the jdbc.properties and solr.properties.

See the test classes under src/test for example usage and test-context.xml for test runtime configuration.
The integration test - IndexTaskProcessingIntegrationTest makes use of the generator daemon and the processor
daemon classes.  Since these classes load configuration from a production environment, configuration should
be present in /etc/dataone/indexing.  This includes jdbc.properties, hazelcast.xml, solr.properties.


Package design:

the index processor has 4 major components:
1. task prioritization and execution:  org.dataone.cn.index.processor

2. document merging logic for processing updates : org.dataone.cn.indexer.SolrIndexService

3. format-specific parsers that convert metadata, systemMetadata, resourceMap, 
   (annotation, and provenance) files into Solr record format:  org.dataone.cn.indexer.parser & spring-bean configurations in src/main/resources and cn-buildout

4. solr communication utilities:  classes for creating and sending and receiving solr records:  org.dataone.cn.indexer.solrhttp  

Logic in the processor package calls the solrIndexService, which calls the parsers, merges changes and sends the updates with the solr communication client.
